Senior Engineer at the BBC building high-traffic APIs and data hydration pipelines. Previously I worked as an engineer at the University of Glasgow in the [Cronin Group](https://www.chem.gla.ac.uk/cronin/) building a software platform for chemical robotics to automate chemistry for a variety of different projects. During this time, I obtained my PhD which focused on the software angle of Chemistry. The work and projects I led there was pivotal to the launch of the spin-off company [Chemify](https://www.chemify.io/) which uses automation to synthesise products at an industrial scale. 

In my spare time, I enjoy building projects with Rust; creating a variety tools / libraries for fun or to help me in my day-to-day work like [Safir](https://github.com/Tyrannican/safir).

I've also built and maintain a [Art Bot](https://github.com/Tyrannican/bsky-art-bot) that posts Magic: the Gathering art work to Bluesky which you can find at [@moxarcana](https://bsky.app/profile/moxarcana.com).

Any questions, feel free to reach out.
